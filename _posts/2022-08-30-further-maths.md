Last year, I took up the challenge to self-learn Cambridge A-level Further Mathematics and in the process I came across a lot of interesting free high-quality online resources which have helped me a lot. The goal of this post is to compile all these resources in one place.

Practising similar questions from past papers over and over again  leads to diminishing returns.  Here are websites where you can find **non-routine questions ranging in difficulty**  :

[Cambridge Examiners Report](https://papers.gceguide.com/A%20Levels/Mathematics%20-%20Further%20(9231)/) | If you are stuck on a question from a Cambridge paper, the examiner's report can be of great help. It points out the common mistakes students are making on each question and occasionally contains explanations. Examiners' reports have the `_er` tag in their names. For example [9231_w20_er.pdf](https://papers.gceguide.com/A%20Levels/Mathematics%20-%20Further%20(9231)/2020/9231_w20_er.pdf).
[Math Exchange](https://math.stackexchange.com/) | Question-answer forum for maths questions. Use it for questions on Pure mathematics.
[Physics Exchange](https://physics.stackexchange.com/)| Question-answer forum for maths questions. Use it for questions on Mechanics.
[Cross Validated](https://stats.stackexchange.com/)|Question-answer forum for statistics questions. Use it for questions on statistics.
[physicsforums](https://www.physicsforums.com/)| Consult the threads on maths and physics.
[r/furthermaths](https://www.reddit.com/r/furthermaths/), [r/alevel](https://www.reddit.com/r/alevel/)| These subreddits are used by A-level students who might be able to help you.
[studentroom](https://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/forum.php) | studentroom has some study help forums that are worth mentioning even though I've never used them.

>Some of the above forums have a **strict etiquette** for posting questions. To increase the chances of someone helping you, you must ask a good question in the right place. Read [here](https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/9959/how-to-ask-a-good-question) and [here](https://physics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/714/how-do-i-ask-homework-questions-on-physics-stack-exchange) on how to ask a good question.
