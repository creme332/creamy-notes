Almost abandoning TOP I must admit, as a Windows user, I seriously considered finding another web development course after reading the following : We [The Odin Project] can only support what is provided within the scope of our curriculum. We do not support... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Resources to self-learn A-level Further Mathematics</title><link href="http://creme332.github.io/creamy-notes/posts/further-maths/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Resources to self-learn A-level Further Mathematics" /><published>2022-08-30T00:00:00+04:00</published> <updated>2022-11-01T14:07:57+04:00</updated> <id>http://creme332.github.io/creamy-notes/posts/further-maths/</id> <content src="http://creme332.github.io/creamy-notes/posts/further-maths/" /> <author> <name>creme332</name> </author> <category term="Maths" /> <summary> Last year, I took up the challenge to self-learn Cambridge A-level Further Mathematics and in the process I came across a lot of interesting free high-quality online resources which have helped me a lot. The goal of this post is to compile all these resources in one place. I am not affiliated in any way with the resources mentioned below.

It comes from Vedic mathematics, a compendium of tricks for increasing the speed of mathematical calculations. The distinguishing feature of this algorithm is the fact that it can be used for mental calculations and it is much faster than the grade-school multiplication algorithm we all learnt. The implementatio... </summary> </entry> </feed>
